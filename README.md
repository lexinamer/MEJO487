## COURSE DECSCRIPTION
The course teaches web development, web design and interactive storytelling. Students will use HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and other programming languages to design, storyboard and script interactive projects. Students will collect and incorporate photos, text, video, graphics and database information into interactive multimedia presentations of the caliber one would expect in a major online publication.

This course expands on the skills learned in MEJO 187 and increases your ability to develop and present interactive media. You will begin by learning more advanced CSS and HTML, with an eye toward the latest CSS methods for responsive design. You will then learn essential skills in JavaScript and JavaScript frameworks (e.g., jQuery). Finally, you will couple your JavaScript skills with a knowledge of data visualization libraries and APIs to produce dynamic, data-driven web apps.

*By the end of this course, you should be able to:*
* Demonstrate proficiency in front-end web development with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript
* Incorporate data, photography, graphics, audio, video and text into a compelling story
* Adhere to ethical journalistic standards
* Design beautiful, innovative, and responsive web apps
* Think programmatically and debug when problems arise

## PREREQUISITES
MEJO 187 - Foundations in Interactive Media (or proven experience in HTML, CSS and responsive design).

## COURSE STRUCTURE
This is a skills-based class, and as such, it takes a project-driven approach to learning. The course is anchored by four (4) major assignments.

### Projects
Each of the four major projects in this course will require you to create an original, interactive web app. Further details will be provided in class. The specifications for each project will be outlined at least two weeks before the deadline, and you will have some time during class to work on the assignments. Do not, however, expect to be able to finish the projects with only the time spent in class; to meet expectations and produce good work, you should plan to spend a generous amount of time outside of the lab.

The fourth and final project should demonstrate the full gamut of web design and development skills you have learned during this course, including (but not limited to) advanced responsive design, JavaScript, jQuery, data visualization, asynchronous data loading, and application program interfaces (APIs). This last project is worth more points than the others because it requires extra effort and must prove that you have mastered all the skills and concepts in the course.

### In-class Exercises, Assignments and Quizzes
Most of the lectures in this course will include in-class exercises to demonstrate the skills and allow you to practice them in real time. You always will be able to use your notes and textbook to complete the exercises, so be sure to bring them to class everyday. Some of these exercises may count as a quiz grade.

In addition to the in-class exercises, there will be approximately 10 smaller assignments to be completed after class. These assignments will challenge you to take the core concepts from the lectures and build upon them. You will try, fail, and try again until you figure it out. I’m happy to help, but individual effort will be taken into account in the grading; there’s no substitute for resilience when learning to code.

### Professional Coding Test
There will be one exam during the second half of the semester, most likely on exam day (*Tues, December 11th at 4:00 pm*). This date may change based on the progress of the course, but regardless, you will be informed with plenty of time to study. This test will be similar to what you might expect during an interview for a junior-level, front-end web development job in the media industry.

### Grading
Your work must meet the following minimum standards to be considered for a grade of B or better:

|    ASSIGNMENTS   |   POINTS EACH  |    % OF GRADE| 
|-----------------------|-------------|-------------| 
| Exercises and Quizzes | 20          | 20%         | 
| Project 1             | 150         | 15%         | 
| Project 2             | 150         | 15%         | 
| Project 3             | 150         | 15%         | 
| Final Project         | 250         | 25%         | 
| Coding Test           | 100         | 10%         | 
| Total                 | 1000        | 100%        | 

|LETTER GRADE |   %     | 
|--------------|--------| 
| A            | 94-100 | 
|   A-         | 90-93  | 
|   B+         | 87-89  | 
|  B           | 84-86  | 
|  B-          | 80-83  | 
| C+           | 77-79  | 
| C            | 74-76  | 
| C-           | 70-73  | 
| D+           | 67-69  | 
| D            | 60-66  | 
| F            | 0-59   | 


*It meets the assignment specifications.*
* It has few, if any, typographical, grammatical, or programming errors.
* It demonstrates a clear grasp of web design and development standards.
* It is completed on time. Deadlines are absolute. Extensions will only be granted because of extenuating circumstances (e.g., illness, etc.), and you must notify me as soon as you are aware of the problem. Your workload -- either in this class or in combination with others -- is not an extenuating circumstance. Unexcused failure to submit your work by the deadline will result in a five-point deduction for the first 24-hour period, followed by 10-point deductions for each day thereafter.

When applicable, your work will also be judged on its aesthetic design, information architecture, usability, consumer value, creativity and innovation.

## GRADING BREAKDOWN

## ATTENDANCE
As mentioned earlier, most of the lectures this semester will include in-class exercises; if you miss the class, you miss the exercise, and since some exercises may count as quizzes, an unexplained absence could hurt your grade. You are allowed one (1) unexcused absence to account for that possibility.

## HONOR CODE & PLAGIARISM
It is expected that each student in this course will conduct himself or herself within the guidelines of the UNC honor code. All academic work should be done with the high level of honesty and integrity this university demands. You are expected to produce your own work in this class. If you have any questions about your responsibility or your instructor’s responsibility as a faculty member under the Honor Code, please talk with me or Senior Associate Dean Charlie Tuggle. You may also speak with a representative of the Student Attorney Office or the Office of the Dean of Students.

In this course, it is acceptable to use coding resources (such as tutorials and libraries) and some source code from sites like GitHub. But the software license must allow for the usage, and the source should be credited, linked and commented in your code and credited visibly on the site, either in the footer or a credits page. The source code should merely serve as a launch pad for your own, original work; it should not be copied wholesale. Information about software licensing is readily available in most sites that provide coding resources.

## RESOURCES & SOFTWARE
### Textbook
JavaScript and JQuery: Interactive Front-End Web Development
By John Duckett
ISBN-13: 978-1118531648

### Software
I will use Atom for in-class demonstrations and assignments, but feel free to use the IDE of your choice -- as long as it allows for efficient, legible editing of HTML/CSS/JavaScript code. Some students prefer Sublime or Kimodo Edit. Do not use Dreamweaver; it is not an industry-standard code editor.

### Hosting
You should already have a web hosting service (i.e. server space) from MEJO 187. If your account has expired, you will need to sign up for a hosting service that allows for the creation of dynamic apps with client-side scripting and SFTP for file transfers. I prefer Web Faction, and I will use that for any demonstrations throughout the course.

### Course Websites
We will use GitHub for coding resources (e.g., starter files for some of your coding assignments) and Github Pages to submit assignments. More information will be given during the semester.

### Screencasts
I may record screencasts as part of the grading process for some of your projects. The screencasts provide real-time feedback, akin to having an employer sitting next to you at the computer and pointing out strengths, weaknesses, coding errors, and suggestions for improvement. I recommend that you watch them. They are short (no more than 15 minutes) and will help you debug and learn new techniques.

### Seeking Help
If you need individual assistance, it’s your responsibility to meet with me. If you are serious about wanting to improve your performance in the course, ask for help as soon as you realize you need it – whether the problem is difficulty with course material, a disability, or an illness. Don't be afraid to admit that you need extra guidance. Web design and development can be daunting, and some of the core concepts can be difficult to grasp at first glance. Before long they will be second nature to you.

## DIVERSITY
The School of Media and Journalism adopted Diversity and Inclusion Mission and Vision statements in spring 2016 with accompanying goals - http://www.mj.unc.edu/diversity-and-inclusion.

UNC is committed to providing an inclusive and welcoming environment for all members of our community and does not discriminate in offering access to its educational programs and activities on the basis of age, gender, race, color, national origin, religion, creed, disability, veteran’s status, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression.

## SPECIAL ACCOMODATIONS
If you require special accommodations to attend or participate in this course, please let the instructor know as soon as possible. If you need information about disabilities visit the Accessibility Services website at https://accessibility.unc.edu/

## ACCREDITATION
The School of Journalism and Mass Communication’s accrediting body outlines a number of values you should be aware of and competencies you should be able to demonstrate by the time you graduate from our program.

Learn more about them here:
http://www2.ku.edu/~acejmc/PROGRAM/PRINCIPLES.SHTML#vals&comps

No single course could possibly give you all of these values and competencies; but collectively, our classes are designed to build your abilities in each of these areas. In this class, we will address a number of the values and competencies, with special emphasis on the "Professional values and competencies" listed below.

* Understand concepts and apply theories in the use and presentation of images and information.
* Demonstrate an understanding of professional ethical principles and work ethically in pursuit of truth, accuracy, fairness and diversity.
* Think critically, creatively and independently.
* Apply tools and technologies appropriate for the communications professions in which they work.
