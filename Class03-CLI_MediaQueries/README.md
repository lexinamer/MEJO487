**Slideshow: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ENOiOMG_cHIlY1iPnypVWnkQ2I_OFA4Eudp-wXYIIqc/edit?usp=sharing**

## Review
- How do we feel about the grid?
- Are things coming back to us now?
- Lets look at cards Homework

### Note
We will get to more creative/design focused stuff. We just have to learn the basics again first. If you can just push through this project (which I recognize is challenging and not exactly stretching your creative muscles), the next few will be more enjoyable.

## Command Line
- Why do we use it?
- What will we use it for:
  - Creating folders (if you want)
  - Submitting larger projects
- Moving around the terminal
- Write down a cheat sheet
- Let's practice together to create a folder that we can use to quickly start projects
  - Include `index.html` `style.css` **FILES**
  - Include `images` **FOLDER**

## Media Queries
- Lets practice together
- Let's create a navigation in the folder we just created
- Now lets make it responsive with media queries

## Review
- Based on the topics we've covered so far, what do you want to review?
- What are you most scared of for Project 1?

## Homework
- Using the terminal, practice creating folders and files and moving around.
  - Create a **folder** called "practicing-terminal"
  - Inside that folder, add 3 other **folders**: "folder1", "folder2", "folder3"
  - Inside each folder, add 2 **files**: "index.html", "style.css"
- You don't have to submit this but we will be having a short timed quiz using the terminal at the start of class. It will primary focus on moving in and out of folders, creating folders, and creating files so practice.
- Create your sketch for CSS Bootcamp

### New Bootcamp deadline - September 12 at Midnight
