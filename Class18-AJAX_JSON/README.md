### Final Projects
Begin researching your final projects and start collecting data and other information. Create a short creative brief describing your project. A creative brief is a summary of every single aspect involved in the project, making it easier for both client and designer to keep track of their progress.

Your creative brief should answer the following:
- What is this project about?
- Who is the project for?
- Why is the project being done?
- What areas of your topic are you going to cover?
- What types of data are you going to look at?
- What other information do you want to show?
