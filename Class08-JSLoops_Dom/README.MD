### Project 2
Come to class on Tuesday with an idea for Project 2. We will be discussing them together at the start of class to be ready to briefly talk about it.

### Hamburger Menu
Using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, build a beautiful responsive header. It should include a logo and navigation.

When the browser shrinks below 767px, make the nav become a clickable hamburger menu.
