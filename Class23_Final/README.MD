# Class 3- Final Class

Congratulations on making it to LDOC!! Hooray! This class should be short and painless.

## Final Project Presentations
Spend a few minutes getting yourself organized to present.

Students will present in this order:
- Yuwei
- Aaron
- Austin
- Tiana
- Arya
- Torin

Remember, keep the presentation professional, don't apologize, and I will cut you off at 5 minutes when the timer goes off. There will be time for Q&A after each student presents.

## Coding Test
The coding test will take place on **Tues, Dec 11 at 4pm**. I've been instructed to remind you that you will not receive a final grade in this class if you don't show up. I will also give you your final project grades and feedback at that point.

The coding test will be a Github repo that you have to pull down and follow a set of instructions to replicate a webpage. Think of it as a mini version of Project 1 that encompasses many concepts we've covered this semester. **It will be open book in the sense that you can use Google and any notes/resources to complete it, however you may not rely on me for help.**

### Concepts you should review:
**CSS Topics**
- Simple grid layout (think rows of items) using Flexbox or floats.  
- Styling a navigation menu both for desktop and mobile
- Basic box model stuff
- Basic additional styling such as hover states, fonts, etc
- Using Media Queries to make something responsive

**Javascript Topics**
- Basic DOM manipulation using jQuery (ie mobile menu)
- Pulling in JSON data using AJAX
- Using For Loops to read data
- Printing data to the page using jQuery
- Creating a simple TauCharts chart from JSON data

**Other Topics**
- Creating a Github Repo and adding commits
- Using a local server
