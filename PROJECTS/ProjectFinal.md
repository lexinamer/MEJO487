# Multipage Web App
We are going to combine projects 3 and 4 to make a responsive, all-encompassing, robust web app that is going to utilize all your skills from this course.
You will be creating a multipage app that will utilize good design, HTML and CSS, jQuery and Javascript, interactive graphs and graphics, external data, and APIs.

## Goal
Come up with an educational topic that you will focus on for the app. The topic needs to be robust enough to have accompanying data and supporting information that you can pull from APIs (think photo streams, tweets, news feeds). While you can have expertise on the topic, you cannot be the main source of information and will need to cite all sources.
Your goal is to create a data-driven, interactive app that accurately tells a story and educates users by showing data in a visual way. The app should be well designed, thoughtful, and interactive. While this app should be primarily visual, some text will be necessary.
We will be working on this as small assignments both as homework and

## Requirements
- Responsive Design
- At least 2 pages (one for the data dashboard and one for the API page)
- Create a loose style guide that your site will follow. This includes color palette, font choices, visual style
- Tasteful use of UI elements to enhance the app (e.g., tooltips, accordion, slider, etc.)
- Clear navigation to go between the pages and some kind of high level introduction to the project.
- One page will be a data dashboard using reputable datasets for the charts and graphs
- At least two (2) charts and one (1) table created with either the charting library we discuss in class
- Use of XML or JSON data in at least one of the charts
- Links to the source data, preferably as captions with the charts, or in a separate list of sources. All of the charts and factual statements in your story should have accurate, specific sources of data. For example, don't just cite 'data.gov;' cite the specific dataset on which you based your chart, e.g. 'U.S. Department of Agriculture 2010 Food Environment Atlas'
- Another page will include APIs and additional media to support the data and topic.
- At least two (2) APIS created from ones we’ve covered in class or additional ones you find. This can include maps, social streams, news feeds, etc
- The APIs must include supporting textual context and source information (if it comes from a specific source)
- Additional images/video/media can also be used to enhance the app
- The third page should include a brief explanation about the project, your information, and any sources (keep in mind, this does not have to be a page in a transitional sense. Something like a modal could work)

## Expectations
Your web app should look good enough and work well enough to be published. It should be polished, professional, and free from grammatical error. All images should be resized and the app should load quickly and work on different web browsers.
You will be presenting these projects on the last day of class, and the presentations will be a part of your grade so prepare ahead of time. You will introduce us to your topic, walk up through the app, and explain any decisions about information you chose to include/not include. You will have 5 minutes to present and a Q&A after.

## Grading
This project is worth 400 points. The breakdown will be the following.

1. Functionality and Code (100 pts)- Does the app work as it is supposed to? Is anything broken? Is your code clean and efficient? Is your app fully responsive?
2. Design (100 pts)- Does your app have cohesive and clear design? Do typography and colors support the app and make sense? Are your charts and data presentation cohesive and understandable. Do your supporting APIs make sense?
3. Story (100 pts)- Did you find an interesting and/or important story in the data and make it clear in the app? Were you able to successfully take a topic and turn it into a compelling interactive visual?
4. Presentations (50 pts)- Is your presentation polished? Have you practiced it? Did you come dressed appropriately and present your work professionally?
5. Requirements (50 pts)- Did you follow all instructions? Are you missing any requirements? Was the project submitted on time and correctly?

## Submission
**Project is due by 5pm on Monday, Dec 3.**

Any submissions after this time will be **15 points** off per **every 12 hours past due**. There is no excuse for a late submission as you will have multiple lab days and plenty of time. 

Presentations will take place on the final day of class (Dec 4)

You will host the project on your own web servers and submit them via a Google Form. You must also include a link to the code on Github.
