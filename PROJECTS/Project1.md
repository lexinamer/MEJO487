# Project 1- CSS Bootcamp

## Requirements:
- All text must be real text. No images.
- The app must be responsive. You may use CSS Grid, FlexBox, and/or Bootstrap. I will view the app on mobile and desktop.
- Navigation roll-overs must work (e.g., the menu items change color)
- Links, hover, visited and active must work; use dummy links (#)
- The JavaScript features do not have to work (e.g., the tooltip does not need to appear when you hover on the donut chart)
- Don't include the table or maps at the bottom
- The footer must be there
- Pay attention to the details while keeping an eye on the deadline. Don't spend too much time on one design element at the expense of finishing the project as a whole.
Purpose:
- Strengthen your CSS skills by tackling new challenges. This project may require some CSS techniques you have not used before; that's the whole point. Figuring out how to create this on your own is the challenge, and knowledge is the reward. You can solve almost any coding problem through Googling, Stack Overflow, and other online resources. In the past, the students who have toughed it out on their own have found it to be a very empowering experience.

## Grading:
This project is worth 150 points. The breakdown will be the following.

1.  Matching the live website (75 pts) - All of the HTML and CSS features are represented in the app and work as indicated in the the live site. This includes hover states, colors, etc.
2. Responsive design (50 pts) - The mobile interface looks good and works well. The layout is user-friendly and meets industry standards
