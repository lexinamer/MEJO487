# Day 1	 | Intro and CSS Review
## Introductions
* About me- designer and developer. Started out my career as a freelance photographer and visual artist. Taught myself how to code. Have Master’s from the j-school in interactive media. Worked as instructor at The Iron Yard and now at an agency.
* Students- Name, year, major, and your least favorite (or hardest) thing about code from 187

## Policies and Procedures
* Run through syllabus and guidelines
* Explain plagiarism as it relates to code
* *Homework*- each day you will be assigned readings, homework, or project work time. Only some of them will be graded- I will let you know ahead of time which ones you need to submit. The others will just be a complete or incomplete.
* *Projects* - There will be 4 main projects that consist the bulk of your grade. You will have plenty of time in class and outside class to complete it.
* *Submissions*- Once we learn Github, you will be submitting your files through Github pages and Google forms. Honestly, I hate Sakai and have found this to be the easiest way to submit assignments and let me see both the code and the live site. Please submit ON TIME.
* *Time* - I expect students to be on time and in their seats at the start of class. Class starts at 5:30- this means your butt should be in the chair at 5:30. Not getting coffee. Not running to the bathroom. In your seat. We have a lot of material to cover and a limited about of time. I will keep a tally of tardiness and dock points for excessive lateness.

## Demos and In Class Notes
* I use Github (the industry standard) for all of my lecture notes, demos, etc. Here is the repo: https://github.com/lexinamer/mejo487 where you can find all information.
* Quickly walk through Github and cloning
* I’ll always include my demo code at the end of the lecture and push it up for your viewing.
