## The Discovery Phase
The discovery phase is the act of finding or learning something for the first time. This includes design research, persona creation, competitor analyses, and creating a content survey.

## The Concept Phase
The concept phase defines the functional requirements for a project, how they should be prioritized and how best to design them. This includes creating sitemaps, sketches, wireframes, and mockups.

## The Prototyping Phase
The prototyping phase allows you to improve a design concept quickly. You can iteratively revise and refine your idea in a matter of minutes, compare designs variations more effectively, and get feedback. This includes prototyping both in code (markups) and with software (Invision), conducting user testing, and getting reviews and approvals from the client.

## The Production Phase
The production phase is the actual development and deployment of the product. This would including building out the project, conducting any last minute revisions or tests, and shipping (deploying) it.
