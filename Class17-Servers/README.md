# Class 17- Servers and Domains

## Lets review the UI challenge

## Servers
A server is a computer designed to process requests and deliver data to another computer over the internet or a local network.

The word "server" is understood by most to mean a web server that shows pages and run apps through web browsers.

### Where to get hosting
- Godaddy
- Webfaction
- Blue Host
- Siteground
- GreenGeeks ...

We are going to be using Greengeeks. Its affordable, reliable, and comes with a free domain that we can use.

Hosting and domain: https://www.greengeeks.com

FTP Client: https://cyberduck.io or https://filezilla-project.org/

### Using your server
- Go to Green Geeks (or your hosting account) and register
- Login and go to cpanel
- Get FTP information
- Login with your FTP client

I'm going to walk around making sure everyone gets set up with their servers. Once you can get access to your servers, I want you to practice by uploading Project 1 and 2 to your server. The URLs should be something similar to *yourdomain.com/project1*


## In Class Project
While I am helping with servers, I want you to do an in class UI challenge.

Topic: Design a responsive newsfeed in HTML and CSS for a topic that interests you. This could be for breaking news, sports stats, gaming things, etc. Think about layout and information that needs to be present.


## Final projects
> go to projects/projectfinal.md


## Final Project Topics
Bring in 2 or 3 well thought out pitches for your final projects. Think about the kind of topics that will work well with both data and APIs. Email me your topics NO later than 5pm on Thursday with the subject "final project topics".
