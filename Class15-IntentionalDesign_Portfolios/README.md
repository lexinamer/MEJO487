# Class 15- Portfolios and Intentional Design

## The rest of the semester...
Hope fall break was good. Thank you for all the feedback from the mid-semester review. It was very helpful in focusing the rest of the curriculum. Between that and grading your slider projects, it has really allowed me to see where gap areas are and focus on that.

- Review curriculum changes
- Review projects changes


## Intentional Design

### Know your brand (before design)
1. Do you have an existing brand to follow (ie Google, NPR, Wash Post, etc)?
2. What themes are you trying to express?
3. Is it text or visual heavy or both?
4. Is the project one cohesive unit or broken into sections?
5. What moods are you trying to express (serious, playful, professional, lighthearted, vintage, somber, etc)?


### Choosing the best typography for projects
Use the branding guide above to start to figure out typography.

- Will one font suffice (keep in mind that one font does not necessarily = boring. play with kerning, font size, weight, color, case, etc)?
- Do serif fonts make sense for your topic?
- Do sans serif fonts make sense for your topic?
- Do you need a decorative font? If so, only use it sparingly and pair with something super neutral and readable.

#### Pairing typography together
- Fonts should be distinct and contrasting from one another but never competing
- Often, a serif and a sans serif font pair well together (one for the headers and one for the main text)
- Avoid pairing different fonts that are too similar. Instead, use fonts from the same family with many styles.
- Don't include more than 2 fonts (unless you have a VERY good reason)

### Working with colors
Use the branding guide above to start to figure out color usage.

- First things first: dark or light scheme?  
- What colors are typically used to describe this theme?
- Are the accompanying visuals include a lot of color already (think about color photography and graphs/maps/charts)?
- Will one color suffice?
- If you need multiple, disparate sections, you can use color blocking (one color per section) to give it variety and cohesion
- FYI, journalism sites often use greyscale color schemes as they content is very dynamic and often colorful. It also lends itself to being more professional and newsworthy.

#### Pairing colors together
- Monochrome (many shades of same color) color schemes work great
- Bright accent color (think pop of pink, yellow, lime green) can be very effective to drive the eye
- Use a color tool such as Adobe Color
- If the design doesn't look good in greyscale, it is probably not going to look good in color.
- Colors can clash super quickly (make sure to look at them all side by side)
- Start with one color and then add more if needed

### Be intentional with layout
- Plan before you start
- Is your content static or dynamic and unpredictable?
- What layout is going to work best for your content (masonry, grid, single column, multiple columns)?
- Multiple page or single page?
- Make sure to think responsively BEFORE you design


## In Class Activity
Each person should spend 5 or so minutes exploring this website (https://thestlbrowns.com/#/). Group up into 3 groups with each group taking one part (color, type, layout). Spend 10-15 minutes dissecting and discussing it and really focus on WHAT is working (or not), HOW it is working, and WHY decisions were made. Each group will then spend a couple of minutes talking about their portion of the site. **DO NOT USE I THINK STATEMENTS**

## Portfolios
Having a good presence on the internet can be vital for getting a job after graduation. It is the first impression that most people can get of you beyond your resume.

- Figure out your tagline and who you want to market yourself as.
- Single page or multipage?
- Process is critical whether a designer or developer
- A homepage is great but make sure to put equal care into the internal project pages if you have them
- You are only as good as your weakest project so curate carefully

Things to include:
1. Name and tagline (quickly get to the point)
2. Blurb about yourself (first or third person?) and possibly a picture or avatar.
3. Easy to find contact information
4. Links to social (Github, Dribbble, Linkedin, Instagram, etc)
5. Your work. Select a few projects that you are the most proud of to include. Again, 2 well thought out and beautiful projects are better than 15 not thought out projects.

Projects should include:
1. Title
2. Links to code and/or live site (if applicable)
3. Your role (especially important it is was a team project)
4. Photos of the final project (if applicable)
4. A brief blurb about the project and some info on process:
  - For designers, focus on the visual steps you took (sketches, wireframes, styleguides,) and explain the problem and solution
  - For developers, still focus on the problem and solution but also include any tech and why you used that
  - For UXers, case studies can often be useful to show you can think through a problem and stratgize a solution

## Homework
### Branding Challenge
This exercise will help you start thinking about the functions of typography and color in relation to a brand.

1. In Codepen, fork [this pen](http://codepen.io/lexinamer/pen/akLYAR) and rename it with `Branding Challenge- Your Name`.
2. Using **only** CSS, style the page to match the company that you drew from the hat.
3. We will go over them in class tomorrow and try to guess what your company is based only on the color scheme and type that you chose.

#### What to submit
Email me your Codepen link by the start of class to lexinamer@gmail.com with the subject "Branding Challenge".

> Notes: Pay attention to the details. Implement Google Fonts, colors ([here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value) is a good list to get started), menu styling, borders, font weight, capitalization, and font size to help you. Remember, you CANNOT touch the HTML.
